## 1. What runs

[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) defines three services on a private bridge network called `umanni-test`:

| Service | Container name | Image | Purpose | Reachable from your machine |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `db` | `umanni-pg` | `postgres:17` | Primary database, plus the Solid Queue, Solid Cable, and Solid Cache databases | No (only inside the network, port 5432) |
| `redis` | `umanni-redis` | `redis:7-alpine` | Started, but not used by the app (see [Known gaps](#13-known-gaps-in-the-current-setup)) | No |
| `web` | `umanni-users` | Built from [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) | Rails 8.1 + Puma, fronted by Thruster | **Yes: http://localhost:3000** |

Containers find each other by container name, so Rails connects to Postgres at `DB_HOST=umanni-pg`.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (or another engine) with **Compose v2**. This guide uses `docker compose ...`. The legacy `docker-compose ...` binary accepts the same commands.
- **The Rails master key.** Ask a teammate for it, or copy it from `config/master.key` if you already have one. You need it because:
  - `User#email_address` is encrypted with Active Record Encryption, and its keys live in `config/credentials.yml.enc`.
  - `config/master.key` is excluded from the image by [.dockerignore](.dockerignore), so the key has to come in through the `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable.
- Port **3000** free on your machine.

> Docker Desktop on macOS installs its CLI in `~/.docker/bin`. If your shell prints `docker: command not found`, add `export PATH="$HOME/.docker/bin:$PATH"` to your shell profile.

---

## 3. Configure `.env`

Compose automatically reads a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml` and substitutes its values into every `${VAR}` in the file. `.env` is ignored by git ([.gitignore](.gitignore)) and never copied into the image ([.dockerignore](.dockerignore)), so secrets stay on your machine.

Create `.env` in the project root:

```dotenv
# Required
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<contents of config/master.key>
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<output of: bin/rails secret   (or: openssl rand -hex 64)>
RAILS_ENV=development
RACK_ENV=development

# Passed through to the container but not used in development
# (development stores uploads on local disk; see section 11)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

The `web` service gets the following environment. Some values are hardcoded in `docker-compose.yml`, so setting them in `.env` has **no effect**:

| Variable | Value / source | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` | `.env` | Decrypting credentials, including the Active Record Encryption keys |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | `.env` | Signing sessions and cookies |
| `RAILS_ENV`, `RACK_ENV` | `.env` (the image also defaults `RAILS_ENV=development`) | Rails environment selection |
| `DB_HOST` | hardcoded `umanni-pg` | [config/database.yml](config/database.yml) |
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | hardcoded `umanni` / `secret` | [config/database.yml](config/database.yml) |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` | Allowed Action Cable origins ([development.rb](config/environments/development.rb)). Boot fails without it. |
| `REDIS_URL` | hardcoded | Nothing (unused) |
| `AWS_*` | `.env` | Only the `amazon` storage service, which development does not use |

---

## 4. Build the image — `docker compose build`

```bash
docker compose build          # builds the `web` image (db and redis are pulled, not built)
```

The first build downloads Ruby, Node, and all gems and npm packages, so it takes several minutes. Later builds reuse cached layers and take about 15–20 seconds when only application code changed.

The resulting image is named `fullstack-developer-web:latest`. [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is a **multi-stage** build:

```
┌──────────────── base ────────────────┐
│ ruby:4.0.6-slim                      │
│ + curl, libjemalloc2, libvips,       │
│   postgresql-client                  │
│ ENV RAILS_ENV=development            │
│     BUNDLE_WITHOUT=development:test  │
└───────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                │
     ┌──────────▼─────────── build ────────────────────────────────┐

     │ 2. npm ci          (package-lock.json layer — cached)       │
     │ 3. COPY . .        (application code)                       │
     │ 4. bootsnap precompile                                      │
     │ 5. bin/rails assets:precompile                              │
     │      → Tailwind build + Vite build into public/vite-dev/    │
     │ 6. rm -rf node_modules                                      │
     └──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                │ copy /usr/local/bundle and /rails only
     ┌──────────▼─────────── final ───────────┐
     │ base + gems + app + compiled assets    │
     │ runs as non-root user `rails` (1000)   │
     │ ENTRYPOINT bin/docker-entrypoint       │
     │ CMD ./bin/thrust ./bin/rails server    │
     │ EXPOSE 80                              │
     └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Things to know about the build:

- **Layer order matters for speed.** Gems and npm packages are installed *before* `COPY . .`. Editing app code reuses those layers. Changing `Gemfile.lock` or `package-lock.json` triggers a full reinstall.
- **Frontend assets are compiled at build time.** Because `RAILS_ENV=development`, Vite writes to `public/vite-dev/` (see [config/vite.json](config/vite.json)). Node is removed from the final image, which works because the assets are already built. At runtime, vite_ruby logs `Skipping vite build. Watched files have not changed since the last build`.
- **Development and test gems are not installed** (`BUNDLE_WITHOUT=development:test`). `web-console`, `rspec`, `rubocop`, `brakeman`, and `dotenv` are therefore **not** in the container. Run tests and linters on your host (or in CI), not in this image. `faker` is a top-level gem, so seeds do work.
- **Secrets are never baked in.** `.env*`, `config/master.key`, `spec/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`, and `log/`/`tmp/` contents are all in [.dockerignore](.dockerignore).

Force a clean rebuild with no cache:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache web
```

---

## 5. Start the stack — `docker compose up`

```bash
docker compose up -d          # start in the background
docker compose logs -f web    # follow the Rails/Thruster logs (Ctrl-C stops following, not the app)
```

Or run in the foreground (logs in your terminal, Ctrl-C stops everything):

```bash
docker compose up
```

Build and start in one step:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**. Health check: `curl http://localhost:3000/up` returns `200`.

### Startup sequence

```
docker compose up
│
├─ db (umanni-pg)
│   ├─ empty pg_data volume? → create user `umanni`, database `umanni_users_development`,
│   │                          run config/postgres/init.sql (first boot only)
│   └─ healthcheck: pg_isready every 5s ───────────────┐
│                                                      │
├─ redis (umanni-redis)                                │
│   └─ healthcheck: redis-cli ping every 5s ───────────┤
│                                                      │ depends_on: service_healthy
└─ web (umanni-users)  ◄───────────────────────────────┘
    └─ bin/docker-entrypoint ./bin/thrust ./bin/rails server
        ├─ args end in "./bin/rails server" → ./bin/rails db:prepare
        │     creates any missing databases, loads schema or runs pending migrations for
        │     primary, queue, cache, and cable
        └─ exec ./bin/thrust ./bin/rails server
              ├─ Thruster listens on :80   (container) ← published as localhost:3000
              └─ Puma listens on 127.0.0.1:3000 (inside the container only)
```

Key points:

1. **`web` waits until Postgres and Redis report healthy** (`depends_on: condition: service_healthy`). It won't start before the database accepts connections.
2. **Migrations run automatically on every boot.** [bin/docker-entrypoint](bin/docker-entrypoint) runs `db:prepare` whenever the command ends in `./bin/rails server`. On a fresh volume it creates and loads all four development databases. On an existing one it only applies pending migrations. Commands like `docker compose exec web ./bin/rails console` skip this step.
3. **The `3000:80` port mapping is intentional.** Thruster (an HTTP/2 proxy that handles gzip, asset caching, and X-Sendfile) listens on port 80 and forwards to Puma on port 3000 *inside* the container. Browser traffic always goes through Thruster.
4. During the first second or two you may see `Unable to proxy request ... connection refused`. Thruster starts before Puma finishes booting, and the message stops once Puma is listening.

### Databases

All four logical databases live in the single `umanni-pg` server:

| Rails role | Database | Purpose in development |
|---|---|---|
| `primary` | `umanni_users_development` | Users, sessions, imports, Active Storage records |
| `queue` | `umanni_users_development_queue` | Solid Queue job tables |
| `cable` | `umanni_users_development_cable` | Solid Cable pub/sub messages (real-time dashboard and import progress) |
| `cache` | `umanni_users_development_cache` | Created by `db:prepare`, but development uses `:memory_store` |

[config/postgres/init.sql](config/postgres/init.sql) also creates `umanni_users_production_{queue,cache,cable}`. That script is shared with the Kamal Postgres accessory. The production databases are unused in development and harmless.

## 6. How a request flows through the system

```
Browser ──http://localhost:3000──► Docker port map ──► Thruster :80 ──► Puma 127.0.0.1:3000 ──► Rails
                                                        (gzip, asset                             │
                                                         caching)                                ├─► Postgres primary (umanni-pg)
                                                                                                 │

                                                    Postgres cable DB (Solid Cable)              │
                                                                                                 │

                                                                                   (must be started — §7)
```

- **Pages** are Rails controllers rendering Inertia.js responses. React components come from the prebuilt bundle in `public/vite-dev/`, served by Thruster.
- **Real-time updates** (dashboard counters, import progress) use Action Cable at `/cable` on the Solid Cable adapter. Solid Cable stores messages in the `cable` database and polls it. No Redis is involved.
- **Background work** (spreadsheet imports on the `imports` queue, debounced dashboard broadcasts on `default`) is enqueued into the `queue` database through Solid Queue. It only runs when a worker process is running (next section).

---

## 7. Background jobs (Solid Queue)

> ⚠️ `docker compose up` does **not** start a job worker. `web` runs only Puma, and `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA` is not set. Until you start a worker, spreadsheet imports stay queued and never make progress.

Start a worker inside the running `web` container:

```bash
# in the background
docker compose exec -d web ./bin/jobs

# or in the foreground, to watch job logs (Ctrl-C stops the worker)
docker compose exec web ./bin/jobs
```

This starts a Solid Queue supervisor with one dispatcher and one worker. The worker has 3 threads and listens on all queues (see [config/queue.yml](config/queue.yml)). Check that it registered:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U umanni -d umanni_users_development_queue \
  -c "select kind, hostname, pid from solid_queue_processes;"
```

The worker lives inside the `web` container, so it stops when `web` stops or is recreated. Start it again after every `up --build`.

**Alternative:** run the worker inside Puma. Add this line to the `web` service's `environment:` list in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
      - SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true
```

[config/puma.rb](config/puma.rb) then loads the `solid_queue` plugin, and the worker starts and stops together with the web server.

---

## 8. Seed the database

```bash
docker compose exec web ./bin/rails db:seed
```

[db/seeds.rb](db/seeds.rb) creates:

- **Admin:** `admin@umanni.test` / `password123`. To choose the password, pass `-e SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=...` to `docker compose exec`. The variable isn't forwarded from `.env`.
- **25 regular members** with Faker names and pravatar avatars, password `password123`.

The admin is created only once, but **every run adds 25 more members**, because Faker generates new unique emails each time.

Reset everything (drop, recreate, load schema, seed):

```bash
docker compose exec web ./bin/rails db:reset
```

---

## 9. Day-to-day development workflow

**The source code is not mounted into the container.** `web` runs the snapshot of the code that was copied in at build time. Rails' code reloading is enabled, but it only sees files inside the image. Edits on your host do **not** show up until you rebuild.

The loop for picking up changes:

```bash
# edit code on your host, then:
docker compose up -d --build web      # rebuild the image (≈15–20s with cache) and recreate the container
docker compose exec -d web ./bin/jobs # restart the worker if you need jobs
docker compose logs -f web
```

`db` and `redis` keep running, and their data persists in named volumes. Pending migrations run automatically when the new `web` container boots.

| You changed... | What to run |
|---|---|
| Ruby, views, React/TS components, CSS | `docker compose up -d --build web` |
| A new migration | `docker compose up -d --build web` (the entrypoint migrates on boot) |
| `Gemfile` / `package.json` | Update the lockfile on the host first (`bundle install` / `npm install`), then `docker compose up -d --build web` (slower: gem/npm layers rebuild) |
| `docker-compose.yml` environment | `docker compose up -d` (Compose recreates the containers that changed) |
| `.env` values | `docker compose up -d` |

### Hot reload (hybrid mode)

For fast feedback (Vite HMR, instant Ruby reloads, tests, linters), run the Rails processes on your host with `bin/dev` ([Procfile.dev](Procfile.dev) starts Puma, the Tailwind watcher, and the Vite dev server), and use Compose only for Postgres. This mode isn't configured out of the box:

1. Publish the Postgres port. Add this to the `db` service:
   ```yaml
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
   ```
2. `docker compose up -d db`
3. On your host (Ruby 4.0.6 and Node 22 installed, after `bundle install && npm install`), export the variables Rails expects. `.env` is not loaded automatically outside Compose:
   ```bash
   export DB_HOST=localhost POSTGRES_USER=umanni POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
          APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
   bin/dev
   ```

Don't run the hybrid `bin/dev` and the `web` container at the same time. Both want port 3000.

---

## 10. Command reference

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build the image | `docker compose build` |
| Start everything (background) | `docker compose up -d` |
| Rebuild and restart the app | `docker compose up -d --build web` |
| Service status and health | `docker compose ps` |
| Follow app logs | `docker compose logs -f web` |
| Start the job worker | `docker compose exec -d web ./bin/jobs` |
| Rails console | `docker compose exec web ./bin/rails console` |
| Shell in the app container | `docker compose exec web bash` |
| Run migrations manually | `docker compose exec web ./bin/rails db:migrate` |
| Seed | `docker compose exec web ./bin/rails db:seed` |
| Routes | `docker compose exec web ./bin/rails routes` |
| psql (primary DB) | `docker compose exec db psql -U umanni -d umanni_users_development` |
| Stop (keep containers and data) | `docker compose stop` |
| Stop and remove containers (keep data) | `docker compose down` |
| **Wipe everything, including the database** | `docker compose down -v` ⚠️ irreversible |
| Clean image rebuild | `docker compose build --no-cache web` |

Commands run through `docker compose exec` execute as the non-root `rails` user (UID 1000) in `/rails`.

---

## 11. Data and persistence

| Data | Where it lives | Survives `down` / `up --build`? |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres (all four databases) | Named volume `fullstack-developer_pg_data` | ✅ Yes. Lost only with `down -v` |
| Redis | Named volume `fullstack-developer_redis_data` | ✅ Yes (unused) |
| Uploaded avatars (Active Storage, `:local` service) | `/rails/storage` **inside the container** | ❌ **No.** Lost whenever the `web` container is recreated |
| Logs | Container stdout (`docker compose logs`) and `/rails/log` | ❌ No |

After a rebuild, users with *uploaded* avatars keep their database records, but the files are gone, so their images break. Avatars set by remote URL are unaffected. To keep uploads, add a volume to `web`:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - storage_data:/rails/storage
```

Then declare `storage_data:` under the top-level `volumes:` key.

`config/postgres/init.sql` runs **only when `pg_data` is empty**. Editing it has no effect on an existing database unless you wipe the volume.

---

## 12. Troubleshooting

**`web` exits immediately, or errors mention credentials or encryption.**
`RAILS_MASTER_KEY` is missing or wrong. Rails can't decrypt `config/credentials.yml.enc`, and so has no Active Record Encryption keys for `User#email_address`. Check `.env`, then `docker compose up -d`.

**`Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated`**
Something else is using port 3000, often a host `bin/dev`. Stop it, or change the mapping to `"3001:80"`. If you change the port, also update `APP_ORIGIN` to `http://localhost:3001`, or Action Cable will reject WebSocket connections.

**`Conflict. The container name "/umanni-pg" is already in use`**
The containers have fixed names, so only one copy of this stack can exist per Docker engine. Remove the old one (`docker rm -f umanni-pg umanni-redis umanni-users`), or run `docker compose down` from the other checkout.

**Code changes don't appear.**
Expected: the code is baked into the image. Run `docker compose up -d --build web` ([section 9](#9-day-to-day-development-workflow)).

**Imports stuck at "pending" / dashboard counters don't update after changes.**
No job worker is running. See [section 7](#7-background-jobs-solid-queue).

**Real-time updates don't arrive (WebSocket fails).**
`APP_ORIGIN` must exactly match the URL in your browser, including scheme and port (`http://localhost:3000`). Using `127.0.0.1:3000` instead of `localhost:3000` fails the origin check.

**`ActiveRecord::PendingMigrationError` in the browser.**
Migrations normally run on boot. If you ran `db:rollback` or similar by hand, run `docker compose exec web ./bin/rails db:migrate`.

**`Unable to proxy request ... connection refused` in the logs right after start.**
Harmless: Thruster started before Puma. It stops once Puma prints `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

**`No route matches [GET] "/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json"`**
Harmless: Chrome DevTools probes for this file.

**Start completely fresh.**
```bash
docker compose down -v            # ⚠️ deletes the database volume
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec web ./bin/rails db:seed
```

---

## 13. Known gaps in the current setup

Configuration quirks you may run into:

- **No job worker service.** Imports need `bin/jobs` started by hand, or `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true` ([section 7](#7-background-jobs-solid-queue)).
- **Redis is unused.** Nothing reads `REDIS_URL`: cache, queue, and cable all run on Postgres through the Solid adapters. The `redis` service can be removed.
- **The image is built with `RAILS_ENV=development`.** The Dockerfile header describes it as a production image for Kamal, but [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) line 23 hardcodes `RAILS_ENV=development`, and [config/deploy.yml](config/deploy.yml) doesn't override it. A Kamal deploy would boot in development mode unless `RAILS_ENV: production` is added to `env.clear`.
- **Uploads aren't persisted** across container recreation ([section 11](#11-data-and-persistence)).
- **`.entrypoint` in the project root is not used.** The image's entrypoint is [bin/docker-entrypoint](bin/docker-entrypoint).
- **AWS variable names don't match.** Compose passes `AWS_BUCKET`, but [config/storage.yml](config/storage.yml) reads `AWS_S3_BUCKET`. Development uses local disk, so it only matters if you switch to the `amazon` service.

### Not to be confused with: the Kamal local rehearsal

[.kamal/local/compose.yml](.kamal/local/compose.yml) is a **separate** Compose file. It starts a fake "production server" (SSH + Docker-in-Docker) for rehearsing `bin/kamal deploy -d local`, served on http://localhost:8080. It has nothing to do with the development stack described here. See the comments in [config/deploy.local.yml](config/deploy.local.yml).
